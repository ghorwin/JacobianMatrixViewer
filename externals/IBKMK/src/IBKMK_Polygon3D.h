/*! Class Polygon3D stores a polygon of 3D points that lies in a plane.
	Also provides utility functions for checking and simplifying polygon. The data structure ensures that the
	polygon itselfs is always consistent. If isValid() returns true, it is guarantied to be in a plane,
	non-winding and without consecutive colinear or identical points. Therefore, the polygon can be
	triangulated right away.

	Internally, the 3D polygon is stored as a 2D Polygon that is placed and oriented in space through
	offset, normal and xAxis vector (the yAxis vector is automatically computed and cached).

	There are several functions for constructing a polygon. All have in common that passing invalid arguments may
	lead to an invalid polygon. Hence, checking the correctness of the polygon after construction is mandatory!

	\note When constructing a polygon with invalid data (polyline, or vectors), the 2D polyline might be empty.
		  You cannot use the polygon to construction incrementally a valid polygon! Always check for validity before
		  using any query functions.
